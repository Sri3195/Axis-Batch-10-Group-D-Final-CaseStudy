                    Whenever there is a liquidity issue, you can go for a personal loan. The purpose of taking a personal loan can be anything from repaying an old debt, going on vacation, funding for the downpayment of a house/car, and medical emergency to purchasing big-ticket furniture or gadgets. Personal loans are offered based on the applicantâ€™s past relationship with the lender and credit score.

                            Before applying for a personal loan, borrowers should find out how much personal loan they are eligible for.
                            The eligibility will typically depend on some specific criteria including their monthly salary or business income, their currently active loans and EMIs as well as the combined outstanding amount on all their credit cards.
                            Basically, it will depend on how creditworthy a person is as a borrower.
